After each report, you'll see a "Quick Actions" card with buttons to instantly trigger:

• 📊 Performance Check - Lates, UPH, and key metrics
• 📅 Yesterday's INF Report - What we missed yesterday

**Subject:** Introducing Amazon Performance & INF Analysis Automation

**Body:**

Hi team,

I'm excited to introduce our new Amazon Performance & INF (Item Not Found) Analysis automation system. This tool will help us identify and resolve stock issues faster, improve performance metrics, and reduce manual reporting time.

### What Is It?

An automated system that scrapes Amazon Seller Central data for all Morrisons stores and delivers comprehensive reports directly to our Google Chat workspace. It runs multiple times daily and can be triggered on-demand with a single click.

### Daily Automated Reports

The system sends 3 scheduled reports each day:

1. **8 AM - Yesterday's INF Analysis**
   - Complete breakdown of items that were marked "not found" yesterday
   - Top 10 most problematic items per store
   - Helps teams prioritize morning stock checks

2. **12 PM - Performance Check**
   - Current day performance metrics
   - Identifies stores struggling with Lates, INF, or UPH
   - Allows teams to course-correct during the shift

3. **2 PM - Today's INF Update**
   - Mid-afternoon snapshot of current INF issues
   - Shows emerging problems before end-of-day

### On-Demand Reports (Quick Actions)

After each automated report, you'll see a "Quick Actions" card with 4 buttons:

- **INF Analysis (Today)** - Instant deep-dive into today's missing items
- **Performance Check** - Latest Lates, UPH, and performance metrics
- **Yesterday's INF Report** - Re-run yesterday's analysis
- **Week-to-Date INF** - Summary from Monday through today

Simply click any button to generate that report immediately. The system prevents duplicate requests (30-minute cooldown per report type) and notifies the chat who requested what.

### What's in the Reports?

**Performance Highlights:**
- Bottom 5 stores for Lates (highest late order percentage)
- Bottom 5 stores for INF (highest Item Not Found rate)
- Bottom 5 stores for UPH (lowest Units Per Hour)
- Job summary with throughput metrics and failure analysis

**Enhanced INF Cards:**
Each problematic item shows:
- High-resolution product image
- Product name and SKU
- Price (from Morrisons API)
- Current stock level and last updated time
- Warehouse location (aisle, bay, shelf)
- Promotional display location (if applicable)
- QR code for quick SKU lookup
- Discontinued/not-ranged alerts

**Network-Wide Summary:**
- Top 10 most problematic items across all stores
- Shows which stores contribute to each problem
- Example: "22 INF - VOSS Water (5 stores: Cleveleys 10, Woking 4, Halifax 3)"

### How to Use It

1. **Automated Reports** - No action needed! Reports arrive at scheduled times.
2. **On-Demand Reports** - Click the button for the report you want.
3. **Review Data** - Use the information to prioritize stock checks and resolve issues.

### Benefits

✅ **Faster Issue Resolution** - Identify and locate problem items instantly
✅ **Better Prioritization** - Focus on stores and items with the biggest impact
✅ **Reduced Manual Work** - No more manually checking each store individually
✅ **Real-Time Insights** - Multiple daily updates keep you informed
✅ **Team Visibility** - Everyone sees the same data at the same time

### Support

The system is continuously being enhanced based on your feedback.
